    title: 'Urban heat and tree cover',
    text: 'Urban greening studies often report a single average temperature reduction for an entire city. Yet a dense network of street-level sensors has revealed that the effect of trees varies sharply by hour and location. Shade can substantially cool exposed sidewalks during the afternoon, while a continuous canopy may slow the release of heat from some streets after sunset. These findings do not weaken the case for planting trees: they show that species, spacing, and the daily rhythms of pedestrian use matter. A plan designed only to maximize canopy percentage may therefore miss opportunities to place cooling where and when residents need it most.',
